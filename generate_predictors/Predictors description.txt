Predictors:

i)Tourism_fpt Tourism footprint;Inverse weighing of Euclidean distance to number of beds in the lodges or campsites,
 so that areas near large lodges have higher values and areas away from small lodges or camps have lower values. 

ii) Edge (Distance to park boundary): Euclidean distance to nearest core protected areas boundary in kilometres.
 The distances were calculated in such a way that inside the protected area the distances were positive while outside negative.

iii)Village_Dist (Distance to nearest village):Euclidean distance to nearest village in kilometres.

iv) Rangerpost_Dist(Distance to park rangerposts): Euclidean distance to nearest park rangerpost calculated in kilometres

v) Temp(Temperature): The degree of hotness or coldness in Celsius extracted from hourly air 
 temperature from ERA5-Land Hourly - ECMWF Climate Reanalysis product
